**Project Motivation & Features**

This is a Django Framework based web application. The main purpose of the project is to provide the user the ease to availability of goods from local market and creating an online interface for the shopkeepers where they can maintain the products, ensure safe and timely delivery to the user. This project is designed for those people who are involved in our market as medium scale shopkeepers and wish to digitize their business in these tough times of pandemic. Ensuring safe and managed delivery of essential goods to the customers is beauty of this project, and this point of customer satisfaction is differentiating this project from other e-commerce websites. The core idea of this webapp is to provide all the essentials like Grocery, Bakery and Medical goods at the same portal resulting in ease of user at the same time allowing the local shopkeepers to take part in the digital world which might prove an asset to them in the near future, So it can be presented in a single image feed that user can access easily by clicking on a particular product user can see the description of that product and after before making the payment can ensure the safe delivery of product as it facilitates user the idea of locality from where the product is being delivered. The order although cancelled is stored in the database to further study the cause.

**Conclusion & Future Work**

In this pandemic time, online and safe delivery of essential goods is the need of the hour. So we
have developed a web application namely, “Essentials Delivery Management During Pandemic”.
This project fulfils the purpose to help people have access to important and essential goods in
these tough times of pandemic and also helped medium class shopkeeper to digitize their shops
for their living and continuous functioning of business. With the support of Django as backend
framework, we have incorporated several features for shopkeepers to manage their warehouse as
well as customers to stay safe in their home and shop online. Also, we have covered various userfriendly
functions like notifying the user of delivery zones, providing goods even at odd hours.
Our product ensured for user to ease the availability of goods from local market and creating an
online interface for the shopkeepers where they can maintain the products, ensure safe and timely
delivery to the user.

**Future Work :**
In Future, other payment options like Paytm, UPI etc. can be integrated for the ease of interaction
with the user. Functionalities in the shopkeeper portal for example to track order whether it’s
delivered safely or no can also be added. At present, application doesn’t manage assigning and
management of delivery boys ,there can be a scope to add the details related to delivery boys and
delivery boy assigned to a particular order for the sake of management to the shopkeeper.
